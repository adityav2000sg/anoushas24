This past year I've watched you grow into someone even more incredible than you already were (which I didn't think was possible). You tackle everything with this energy that's equal parts ambitious and effortless, and honestly it's inspiring.

I made this little corner of the internet because you deserve more than a card. You deserve something you can come back to whenever you need a reminder of how amazing you are — and how much you're loved.

The 24 wishes? I mean every single one. The jar notes? They're for the days when Dubai feels far from home or work gets heavy. Come back here whenever you need to.

Here's to 24 being YOUR year. New city, new adventures, same incredible you. I can't wait to watch you absolutely crush it.`,
