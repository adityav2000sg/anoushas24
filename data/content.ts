I’ve watched you take on a lot — plans, goals, decisions, everything that comes with building a life you’re proud of — and you handle it with this mix of grace and drive that’s genuinely rare. You’re thoughtful, you work hard, and you still manage to be the kind of person people feel better around.

I made this little corner of the internet because a card never feels like enough. I wanted you to have something you can come back to whenever you feel like it — a reminder of the best parts of you, written down in one place.

The 24 wishes are all real. And the jar notes are for any day you just want a small lift — before a big moment, after a long day, or for no reason at all.

I’m excited for everything ahead of you this year — and I’m proud of you already. Always in your corner.`,
